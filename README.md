# Hi there 👋 I'm Lindsay 🦁 (she/her) 👱‍♀️

## About me (the tech-y stuff)

I'm currently a student 👩‍🎓 at Epicodus, learning all things JavaScript , C# and React. I'm interested in building mobile applications, especially mobile games, so I'm also independently looking into different ways to build native apps! What's your favorite?

## About me (the not so tech-y stuff)
My background is in customer service 🧑‍💼. I spent nearly 10 years of my career at Airbnb which taught me the value of working for a company who truly cares for its employees. I live in Portland, OR with my husband 🙋‍♂️ , dog 🐶, and cat 🐱. We love to travel 🌴 and check out new bars 🍻 around town.
